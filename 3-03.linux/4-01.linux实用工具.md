#### htop

就如它的名字 `human top` 一样，`htop` 是比 `top` 更人性化的进程监控工具。

```
NAME
       htop - interactive process viewer

SYNOPSIS
       htop [-dChusv]

DESCRIPTION
       Htop is a free (GPL) ncurses-based process viewer for Linux.

       It is similar to top, but allows you to scroll vertically and horizontally, 
       so you can see all the processes running on the system, 
       along with their full command lines.

       Tasks related to processes (killing, renicing) can be done without entering their PIDs.
